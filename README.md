# sql-usa-city-and-state-one-table
This is a .sql file that creates a "locations" table in MYSQL that has all 28,000 cities in the US in the format varchar("City, ST").

Bro! What are you doing?! Normalize that repeated data into a cities and states table and join them with a foriegn key - you're working with a relational database.  Sometimes Billy, there's a place and a need for the simpicity of just having all of the cities and their state abbreviations stored as a string in one table.  Like in an app's location autocomplete/typeahead.
