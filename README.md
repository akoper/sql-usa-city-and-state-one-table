# sql-usa-city-and-state-one-table
This is a .sql file that creates a "locations" table in MYSQL that has all 28,000 cities in the US in the format varchar("City, st").

Bro! What are you doing?! Normalize that repeated data into a cities and states table and join them with a foriegn key.  Sometimes Billy, there's a place and a need for the simpicity of just having a string of all of the cities and their state abbreviations stored in one table.

If me doing this work and open sourcing it saved you many hours of work and stress, you're welcome to Venmo, CashApp, Zelle, or PayPal me a little something.  Links are on my homepage, [akoper.com](http://www.akoper.com/)
